# DashAI Browser UI Components

This directory contains the UI components of the DashAI Browser, providing intelligent and adaptive user interfaces that enhance the browsing experience.

## Components

### Adaptive Rendering Engine
The `AdaptiveRenderingEngine` component dynamically adjusts the rendering of web pages based on user preferences, device capabilities, and content characteristics. It can optimize readability, reduce distractions, and improve accessibility.

### AI Provider Selector
The `AIProviderSelector` component provides a UI for selecting and configuring AI providers. It allows users to choose which AI service to use for different features and configure provider-specific settings.

### AI Settings Page
The `AISettingsPage` component provides a comprehensive settings page for configuring AI features in the browser. It includes options for selecting AI providers, configuring privacy settings, and customizing AI behavior.

### Contextual Manager
The `ContextualManager` component maintains context across browsing sessions, enabling more intelligent and personalized interactions. It tracks the user's browsing context and provides relevant information to other components.

### Memory Palace
The `MemoryPalace` component organizes and visualizes the user's browsing history, bookmarks, and saved content in a spatial memory system. It helps users find and recall information they've previously encountered.

### Predictive Omnibox
The `PredictiveOmnibox` component enhances the browser's address bar with AI-powered predictions and suggestions. It can suggest URLs, search queries, and actions based on the user's browsing context and history.

### Semantic Search
The `SemanticSearch` component provides natural language search capabilities for finding content across the web and within the user's browsing history. It understands the meaning of search queries and returns semantically relevant results.

### Summarization UI
The `SummarizationUI` component provides a user interface for the AI-powered summarization feature. It includes the Synapse button in the Omnibox and the summary sidebar that displays content summaries.

## Integration with AI Components

These UI components integrate with the AI components in the `browser_core/ai` directory:

- `AdaptiveRenderingEngine` uses `ContentUnderstanding` to analyze page content and optimize rendering.
- `MemoryPalace` uses `ContentUnderstanding` to extract and organize information from web pages.
- `PredictiveOmnibox` uses `SmartSuggestions` to generate intelligent suggestions.
- `SemanticSearch` uses `ContentUnderstanding` to understand search queries and content.
- `SummarizationUI` uses `SummarizationService` to generate and display content summaries.
