# ASOL Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidelines and best practices for optimizing the performance of the ASOL system. It covers various aspects of performance optimization, including memory management, CPU usage, network efficiency, and UI responsiveness.

## Performance Tracking

The ASOL system includes a performance tracking utility (`asol/util/performance_tracker.h`) that can be used to measure and analyze the performance of various operations. This utility should be used to identify performance bottlenecks and validate optimizations.

### Usage Example

```cpp
// Track a specific operation
{
  ASOL_TRACK_PERFORMANCE("ProcessTextRequest");
  // Code to be measured
  adapter->ProcessText(text_input);
}

// Get performance statistics
auto tracker = asol::util::PerformanceTracker::GetInstance();
LOG(INFO) << "Average processing time: " 
          << tracker->GetAverageDuration("ProcessTextRequest").InMilliseconds() 
          << "ms";
```

## Response Caching

The response cache (`asol/util/response_cache.h`) provides a way to store and reuse AI responses, reducing the need for repeated API calls. This can significantly improve performance for common queries.

### Usage Example

```cpp
// Get a response from the cache
auto cache = std::make_unique<asol::util::ResponseCache>();
const auto* cached_entry = cache->Get(query, adapter_id);

if (cached_entry) {
  // Use the cached response
  return cached_entry->response;
} else {
  // Get a new response from the API
  auto response = adapter->ProcessText(query);
  
  // Cache the response for future use
  cache->Put(query, response, adapter_id);
  
  return response;
}
```

## Critical Path Optimization

The critical path for ASOL is the request-response cycle between the user and AI models. This path should be optimized for maximum performance.

### HTTP Client Optimization

- Use connection pooling to reduce connection setup time
- Implement request batching for multiple small requests
- Use streaming responses for large responses
- Set appropriate timeouts to avoid hanging requests

### Response Processing Optimization

- Use incremental parsing for streaming responses
- Process responses in a background thread
- Minimize JSON parsing overhead
- Use efficient data structures for response handling

### UI Responsiveness

- Offload heavy processing from the UI thread
- Use progress indicators for long-running operations
- Implement incremental UI updates for streaming responses
- Optimize rendering of conversation history

## Memory Management

Proper memory management is crucial for maintaining good performance, especially in a browser environment where memory is shared with other components.

### Best Practices

1. **Use Smart Pointers**: Prefer `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` over raw pointers
2. **Avoid Memory Leaks**: Ensure all resources are properly cleaned up
3. **Minimize Copying**: Use move semantics and references where appropriate
4. **Limit Cache Size**: Set appropriate limits for response caching
5. **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when needed
6. **Resource Pooling**: Reuse expensive resources like network connections

## Network Efficiency

AI API calls can be expensive in terms of network usage. Optimizing network efficiency can improve performance and reduce costs.

### Best Practices

1. **Minimize Request Size**: Send only necessary data in requests
2. **Compress Requests/Responses**: Use gzip compression for HTTP requests
3. **Use Streaming**: Stream responses for large requests
4. **Implement Retries**: Add exponential backoff for failed requests
5. **Set Timeouts**: Avoid hanging on slow or failed requests
6. **Cache Responses**: Avoid redundant network requests

## Build Optimization

Optimizing the build system can improve development efficiency and runtime performance.

### Best Practices

1. **Minimize Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies
2. **Optimize Include Hierarchy**: Use forward declarations where possible
3. **Precompiled Headers**: Use precompiled headers for common includes
4. **Link-Time Optimization**: Enable LTO for release builds
5. **Profile-Guided Optimization**: Use PGO for critical components

## Performance Testing

Regular performance testing is essential to maintain and improve performance over time.

### Testing Approaches

1. **Benchmark Tests**: Create dedicated benchmark tests for critical operations
2. **Load Testing**: Test performance under high load
3. **Memory Profiling**: Monitor memory usage over time
4. **CPU Profiling**: Identify CPU-intensive operations
5. **Network Profiling**: Measure network efficiency

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, analysis, and improvement. By following the guidelines in this document and using the provided utilities, you can ensure that the ASOL system maintains high performance and responsiveness.
