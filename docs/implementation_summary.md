## Implementation Approach

The implementation followed these key principles:

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: Easy integration of new AI models and services
3. **Simplicity**: Straightforward API for client code
4. **Robustness**: Proper error handling and configuration validation
5. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage with mock components

This foundation provides a solid base for future development and expansion of the AI capabilities in DashAIBrowser.
