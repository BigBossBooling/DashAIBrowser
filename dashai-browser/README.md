# DashAIBrowser

Welcome to the DashAIBrowser monorepo!

This repository contains the source code for DashAIBrowser, an AI-native web browser designed to transform your browsing experience into an active, personalized, and profoundly efficient journey.

## Project Vision

To engineer the world's most intelligent, intuitive, and secure AI-native web browser, transforming the passive browsing experience into an active, personalized, and profoundly efficient journey. DashAIBrowser will act as your AI co-pilot for the internet, proactively assisting, summarizing, protecting, and creating, all while upholding user sovereignty and data integrity.

## Directory Structure

- `browser_core/`: Contains the core C++ components of the browser, likely built upon a modified Chromium or WebKit engine.
- `asol/`: The AI Services Orchestration Layer, potentially implemented in Rust, responsible for managing interactions with various AI APIs.
- `proto/`: Protocol Buffer definitions for inter-service communication (e.g., between browser_core and ASOL).
- `docs/`: Project documentation, including design documents, technical specifications, and user guides.
- `tests/`: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for all components.
- `scripts/`: Build scripts, deployment scripts, and other utility scripts.
